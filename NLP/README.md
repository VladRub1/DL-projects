# NLP

This section presents the following works in the field of 
**Natural Language Processing** (_NLP_):
* [Distributed ML](./Distributed%20ML): **parallel training** of the **GloVe** model 
  to obtain vector representations (**embeddings**) of words.
* [Machine Translation](./Machine%20Translation): custom implementation of several 
  types of **RNN models** (_LSTM and GRU_), as well as **fine-tuning of a transformer** 
  architecture model for **machine translation** from English to Russian.
