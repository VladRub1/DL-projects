# Fully Connected

This section presents implementations of projects with 
**fully connected neural networks**:
* **[Generative Models (GAN & Diffusion)](./Generative%20Models%20(GAN%20&%20Diffusion))**:
The task of conditional generation of synthetic data based on the _MAGIC_ dataset 
(Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) â€” gamma quanta (**photons**) and hadrons 
(**protons**) using
  * **Generative Adversarial Network** (_GAN_)
  * **Diffusion Model**
* **[YearPredictionMSD](./YearPredictionMSD)**: solution for predicting the release year 
of a song based on various musical characteristics based on 
[Million Song Dataset (MSD)](http://millionsongdataset.com/).
